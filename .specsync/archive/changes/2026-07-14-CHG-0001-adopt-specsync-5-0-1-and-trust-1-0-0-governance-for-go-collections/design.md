# Design

Keep the existing Go workflow byte-for-byte unchanged. Add one independent
trust job for every pull request and main push using full Git history, the Go
version declared by go.mod, and Trust's immutable v1.0.0 commit.

Trust delegates lifecycle validation to a Fledge lane that runs formatting, vet, race-enabled uncached tests, and builds.
Risk blocks, provenance is progressive, and Trust-managed Atlas is disabled.
No source, module, release, secret, or public behavior changes.
